# Mini Project: Noughts & Crosses Summary

## Provided files

- `noughts-and-crosses`:
    - `/skeleton` to be zipped and provided to the Academites as the starting point
    - `/skeleton-tdd` For after the Unit Testing sessions - an optional skeleton that has Jest setup to use some TDD to make the project work - to be zipped and provided to the Academites as the starting point if they want to try it as a stretch goal
    - `/solution` a sample reference solution for the **Instructors** only
    - `/solution-pure-fns` as above but with the code rearranged to be more "pure" as an example

## Instructors notes

1. Distribute the `skeleton.zip`, instructions for cohort are below:
1. The main introduction session should take ~0.5 hours, to discuss & show.
1. If anyone shoots through the Noughts & Crosses implementation suggest they can stray outside of the `academy.js` file to add features like named players, win counters, automated players, etc.
1. Giving a chance for a few of them to share how they solved different parts of the Noughts & Crosses is a good idea (e.g. state representation, win detection) as it should promote some healthy discussion.

## Cohort instructions (repeated from the slides)

1. You'll find a few files for the mini-project in the `skeleton.zip` file:
    1. `academy.js` - the JavaScript file containing some function stubs. This is what you should add to in order to get the game working.
    2. `index.html` - the webpage that Noughts & Crosses will render on. Open this in your browser to see your code working. You shouldn't need to edit this file.
    3. `main.css` - some basic styling for the game, you shouldn't need to make changes here.
    4. `connectors.js` - logic to join up academy.js to the webpage, you shouldn't need to make changes here either.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. Press F12 (or your browsers equivalent) to open the developer tools, and navigate to the console.
3. Clicking on the grid and reset button should print messages in the console that line up with the functions in `academy.js`
4. Fill out the functions in `academy.js` to make the game work! Check the console in your browser for error messages as you go. Make small changes, use log messages and refresh the browser often to check your code.
5. If you get stuck, ask for help!

### Bonus task(s)

If you get the game implemented and working, feel free to have a look at the other files in the project and make any improvements you'd like. Some ideas are in the provided main presentation.
